## About
This is a tool for simplifying 3D geometries of .obj files.
I quickly threw this together with code from another project of mine while I got the mesh optimization code from this post [here](https://discourse.threejs.org/t/mesh-simplification-using-meshoptimizer/63002). 
I thought I'd put it online in case someone finds it useful.
